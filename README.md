If a file does not exist for an object within the TTS save, then that object does not contain any scripts or the scripts are irrelevant to the functionality of the main tools used in the mod.


Credit and thanks to ThePants999, Trashpanda, GenWilhelm, BaconCatBug, Phubar, Mothman_Zack, Zyllos and Kurcenkurce for their hard work developing/maintaining earlier versions of this mod, and elements contained within it!
